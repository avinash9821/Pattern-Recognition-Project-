# Pattern-Recognition-Project

The codes of Sequence-to-Sequence model architectures for chatbot development using LSTM variant is present in this repository. LSTMwithAdam.ipynb file uses cross entropy loss function and ADAM optimization algorithm while LSTMwithSGD.ipynb file also uses cross entropy loss function alongside Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) optimization algorithm.
